# pixinv

A Space Invaders and Galaga inspired 2D shooter game written with Raylib.

# Purpose

I initially started this to have an object-oriented program to apply my newly-found C++
knowledge on and to get experience with the language. It also served to give me an
introduction to the realm of 2D game development, which has always coincided with my
computer science interest.

pixinv was not and still is not a program that I have/will spend a lot of focus on: it
is just a fun small game I am making on the side. Given this, you should know that **the
game is largely incomplete right now**. This was originally because I ran into a confusing
memory error (C++ error messages were far too cryptic for me) and eventually got preoccupied
with other tasks. I have since fixed that segmentation fault and am now only going to slowly
complete this game while prioritizing other software.

**Currently, the game only draws the enemies and player onto the screen, with the player having
the capability to shoot lasers.** That is it: enemies don't die or shoot back at you yet. However,
it is useful to use and copy the code in accordance with the license; it is a decent start if you
are looking to make your own shooter game similar to this one or if you want to learn more on
game development, Raylib, or C++.

This information is all that will be helpful at this point, so I will update this README as
development progresses and its useful.
